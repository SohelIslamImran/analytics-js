# firebase-analytics

A Node.js client for Google Firebase Analytics

A pure JavaScript Google Firebase Analytics implementation that uses the HTTPS Measurement API 2 to send events to Google Analytics.

This class provides an alternative for the Firebase Analytics module shipped with the Firebase JS SDK.

FirebaseAnalytics provides a bare-bone implementation of the new HTTPS Measurement API 2 protocol (which is undocumented), with an API that follows the Firebase Analytics JS SDK.
